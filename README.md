# Perceptron

This repository contains an implementation and study material related to the **Perceptron**, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and neural networks.

A Perceptron is a linear binary classifier that computes a weighted sum of input features and applies a threshold-based activation function to produce an output. During training, weights are updated iteratively using the Perceptron learning rule based on classification errors. The algorithm is limited to linearly separable data but serves as a core concept for understanding more complex neural network architectures.

## Repository Overview

The code in this repository focuses on:

* Implementation of a single-layer Perceptron
* Forward computation using weighted summation and activation
* Training using iterative weight updates
* Understanding linear decision boundaries
* Binary classification behavior

## Structure and Usage

The repository is organized to keep the implementation simple and readable, prioritizing clarity of logic over optimization. The code is intended for learning, revision, and conceptual verification of how a Perceptron works internally.

## Scope

* Covers only basic Perceptron concepts
* Uses simple data representations
* Emphasizes algorithmic understanding rather than application scale

This repository serves as a reference point for foundational machine learning concepts and low-level understanding of linear classifiers.
